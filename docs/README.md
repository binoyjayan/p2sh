As the name suggests, `p2sh` is an easy-to-learn, powerful programming language
designed for packet processing. Its elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together
with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for developing tools and
utilities meant to process packets effectively. It has efficient high-level
data structures that help write simple packet processing utilities quickly and
with ease. It is a work in progress, and features specific to packet processing
are yet to be added. For a brief overview of the language's features, you can
find a quick walkthrough here.
